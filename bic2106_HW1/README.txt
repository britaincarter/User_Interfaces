To run the web application all you need are the files located under part_2. You can simply run it in
google chrome or any other web browser and it should come right up by simply clicking on the index.html file. 
This should run it through the file system on your machine. When it comes up you should see
an image in the background with "We the People" with the house of congress and the founding fore fathers
in the background. I tried to stick to color palets that were informative and went together that also 
worked with the image. I made sure that all my text were very short sentences so they were easily scannable
and could be interpreted quickly by anyone trying to use the site. 

When I made the form that they use the filters I decided to make it so they could select either roles or
levels. When they select them they appear to the right of either Levels Selected and Roles selected with a
button for them to be easily removed by a clearly labeled remove button. I also placed these filters that they had selected directly under the 
descriptions of the filters on purpose so they understood what they were filtering. If they were to click on 
execute without filling out the address I have a red border that will inform the user that they are missing  the address, as well as a pop up informs them 
of what to do (which address is minimum requirement for api query). I decided to use select to limit confusion of how to apply a variety of filters. The include 
offices I deliberatly made differently then the rest of the filters. I made it as a checkbox because I wanted the user to understand that they "ONLY"
get the office positions and not the officials. It becomes a yes or no answer for the user with a checkbox. 

I made the site smaller initially so that it didn't take up the whole screen on purpose because I did not want the user to feel 
overwhelmed by too much material. As they click and add more levels/roles (filters) the screen slowly goes down 
and covers up the image. Once they click the button "execute" the table shows up and extends the rest of the site. 
I wanted the execute button to be obvious that it was the end goal so therefore it is in a different color from
the rest of the form to apply filters. As well as it is in the same color of when they first arrived to the site
so it ties together from start to finish what they are doing. The only thing that is required for them to do is
located directly in the highlighted area. 

I also added a small bar that seperates the introduction and the form. I felt that it made it an easier transition aesthetically.
It also leads the eyes to reading the quote on the right that I felt was applicable with a site providing information to the users
about who represents them. The quote is the only words in white because I wanted it to stand out and be clear that it wasn't informative
regarding the interface.

When the table is created I decided to use horizontal lines as borders for the table because I felt like the connection
was on every row and makes it easier to organize when reading. Also as they hover over the row it highlights in a color
similar to that of the highlighted area of the form where they create filters. Obviously the titles of the header are bigger
to highlight the columns they represent. As well as they have a larger bottom border than the rest of the table.

The site is simple yet and prevents the user from being confused by errors within the system. At no point do the users
need to recall information from a previous page. The remove button for the filters makes it easy for the user to change
what they have already done. When looking on the internet I found that to standards whenever a user is filling a form, a
red border indicates that they need to fill out that information at least. As well as aesthetically/consistency standards usually
have forms that are being filled out by users be a different color than the rest of the site to attract the attention to typing in
the input. 

I got all required functionality into the web application except involving viewing only 10 items at 
once and being able to cycle through those items with a next and previous button. 
 
I have an extra file called attempt which uses the same index.html, styles.css files (just a different .js file). 
This is where I attempted to add additional functionality to my already existing tables by adding the 
next/previous buttons by using the DataTables framework. I then realized that we were not allowed to use .net
features and had to abandon this pursuit.
