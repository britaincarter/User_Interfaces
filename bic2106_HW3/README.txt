HW3 - MVP

All design information can be found in the Documentation.pdf. All dependencies are included in the
folder named MVP. My code resides in index.html, styles.css, and script.js. (script.js is a mixture
of my code and the recognizers code.) The other dependencies are: canvas.text.js, initial.js, and 
jquery-1.7.2.min.js. This web application can be simply launched through the file explorer and 
opening up index.html. 

When using the application if you attempt to add a new video and the video does not load it is 
because the source of where the video is located is unavailable. 

My design is fully functional.
